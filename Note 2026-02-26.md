> Sorry if I am sharing too much of my internal process, it helps to put it in writing.

I’m a big fan of brainstorming, so I think sharing our internal thoughts is really helpful. Seeing your perspective is making it easier for me to learn.

In brainstorming, it’s perfectly okay if we’re not all at the same level of understanding. Often, just asking questions that might seem silly can lead to better ideas. You’re much more familiar with this topic than I am.

Aside: Another thing I’m really interested in is songwriting. Brainstorming is a first class idea in songwriting. I see some similarities in software development, but brainstorming isn’t as widely recognized as a useful concept in software development. Software development tends to hide its process too much.

Are you in Europe or in N/A? I'm looking at timestamps in the emails and trying to guess, for future reference.
